# 02 — User Personas & Jobs-to-be-Done

## 1. Marco Ferretti — Operations / Site Manager

| | |
|---|---|
| **Role** | Site Manager at a mid-size construction company (85 employees, 6 active sites) |
| **Age** | 42 |
| **Tech comfort** | Moderate — lives in WhatsApp and Excel, avoids anything that needs a login he'll forget |

### Goals
- Know where every crew and piece of equipment is right now without calling five people.
- Assign and reassign tasks on the fly when plans change (they always change).
- Have a paper trail when the client asks "who authorized that crane move?"

### Frustrations
- "I spend half my morning just figuring out what actually happened yesterday."
- Crews confirm tasks with a thumbs-up emoji and he has no idea if that means *received* or *done*.
- He keeps a whiteboard, a spreadsheet, and a WhatsApp group — none of them agree with each other.
- When a piece of equipment goes missing between sites, nobody knows who had it last.

### Jobs-to-be-Done
1. **When** I start my day, **I want to** see which tasks from yesterday are still open, **so I can** reprioritize before the 7AM standup.
2. **When** a client calls with an urgent change, **I want to** reassign a crew and notify them instantly, **so I can** keep the project on track without playing phone tag.
3. **When** equipment moves between sites, **I want to** know who signed it out and where it is, **so I can** stop losing €2K generators in the void.

### A Day in the Life
Marco's alarm goes off at 5:45. By 6:10 he's scrolling WhatsApp — three groups, two of which have 40+ unread messages. Somewhere in there, Luigi said the excavator broke down yesterday at 17:30, but Marco only sees it now buried under memes and voice notes. He calls Luigi. No answer. Calls Davide. Davide says "I think they moved it to Via Roma?" Marco drives to Via Roma. The excavator is not there. It's at the other site. He's lost 90 minutes. With ShiftBuddy, the breakdown would've been a structured message he'd see on a dashboard at 6:10, with a GPS pin and a photo. He'd reassign the backup excavator from his phone before coffee.

## 2. José Medina — Field Worker / Crew Member

| | |
|---|---|
| **Role** | Equipment operator and crew member at a logistics/equipment rental company (45 employees) |
| **Age** | 29 |
| **Tech comfort** | Low — uses WhatsApp and YouTube, that's it. Will not download another app. |

### Goals
- Know what he's supposed to do today, where, and with what equipment — without guessing.
- Clock in, do the work, go home. Minimal admin.
- Not get blamed when something goes wrong that wasn't his fault.

### Frustrations
- "They changed my assignment at 6AM and told me in a group chat with 50 messages. I didn't see it."
- Handoff paperwork is a clipboard that gets wet, lost, or ignored.
- He once got blamed for a damaged generator because there was no record that it was already damaged when he received it.
- "If they make me install another app I'm going to lose it."

### Jobs-to-be-Done
1. **When** I wake up, **I want to** get a clear message with my tasks, site address, and equipment list, **so I can** show up to the right place with the right stuff.
2. **When** I receive equipment, **I want to** confirm the handoff with a photo and a tap, **so I can** prove it was already scratched when I got it.
3. **When** I finish a task, **I want to** mark it done in 5 seconds, **so I can** move on without filling out forms.

### A Day in the Life
José checks his phone at 6:15 while eating breakfast. He has 3 WhatsApp notifications — one from his girlfriend, one from the work group (a forwarded safety PDF), and one from Marco saying "go to Via Napoli today, take the small compressor." He replies 👍. What Marco doesn't know: José already loaded the *large* compressor last night because yesterday's message said something different. He shows up at Via Napoli with the wrong compressor. Forty-minute round trip to swap it. With ShiftBuddy, José would get a single structured task card in WhatsApp: site, address, equipment list, map link. He taps "Accept." If the equipment list changed, he'd get a highlighted update. No ambiguity.

## 3. Serena Bonetti — Fleet / Asset Manager

| | |
|---|---|
| **Role** | Fleet & Equipment Manager at a regional equipment rental company (120 employees, 800+ tracked assets) |
| **Age** | 37 |
| **Tech comfort** | High — comfortable with SaaS tools, runs reports, manages a fleet tracking spreadsheet with 47 tabs |

### Goals
- Know the real-time location and status of every asset over €500.
- Maximize utilization — idle equipment is burning money.
- Predict maintenance before breakdowns happen on-site (and cause downtime penalties).

### Frustrations
- "I have a €3M asset fleet and I'm tracking it on spreadsheets because our guys won't use the fancy software we bought."
- Rental returns come back damaged with no documentation. Disputes cost more than repairs.
- She finds out equipment is idle only when someone physically walks past it.
- "I bought a GPS fleet tool. The field guys never open it. The data is three weeks stale."

### Jobs-to-be-Done
1. **When** a rental asset is returned, **I want to** see a timestamped condition report with photos from the crew, **so I can** bill for damages immediately instead of discovering them a month later.
2. **When** I plan next week's allocations, **I want to** see which assets are idle, booked, or in maintenance, **so I can** stop double-booking the same forklift.
3. **When** an asset hits its maintenance threshold, **I want to** get an automatic alert, **so I can** schedule service before it fails on a job site.

### A Day in the Life
Serena opens her Monday with a 47-tab spreadsheet ritual. She cross-references the WhatsApp groups (where operators *sometimes* report issues) with the GPS tracker (which half the trucks have) and the maintenance log (a shared Google Doc that three people actually update). By 10AM she discovers that a €15K mini-excavator was returned on Friday with a cracked hydraulic line — and nobody logged it. The next rental is tomorrow morning. She scrambles to find a replacement. With ShiftBuddy, the return handoff would've included condition photos and a checklist. The hydraulic issue would've been flagged Friday at 16:00, and the Monday rental would already have a backup assigned.

## 4. Antonio Ferrara — Business Owner

| | |
|---|---|
| **Role** | Owner-operator of a field services company (60 employees, plumbing/HVAC/electrical) |
| **Age** | 54 |
| **Tech comfort** | Low-to-moderate — uses WhatsApp constantly, checks dashboards if they're simple, won't learn complex software |

### Goals
- Stop losing money to misplaced equipment, unbilled hours, and he-said-she-said disputes.
- Get a pulse on operations without calling three managers every morning.
- Grow from 60 to 100 employees without the back office collapsing.

### Frustrations
- "Last year we wrote off €40K in lost or unaccounted-for tools and equipment. I know it's worse than that."
- He suspects jobs are taking 30% longer than they should, but has no data to prove it.
- "I bought Jobber. Nobody used it. I bought ServiceTitan. Too complex. My guys live on WhatsApp. I give up."
- He gets pulled into operational fires daily because there's no system — just tribal knowledge.

### Jobs-to-be-Done
1. **When** I check my phone on Sunday evening, **I want to** see a weekly summary of completed jobs, open issues, and asset status, **so I can** know if Monday will be a fire drill or not.
2. **When** I'm deciding whether to buy or rent more equipment, **I want to** see utilization data, **so I can** make the call with numbers instead of gut feel.
3. **When** a customer disputes a job, **I want to** pull up the task log with timestamps and photos, **so I can** resolve it in one call instead of three days of back-and-forth.

### A Day in the Life
Antonio arrives at the office at 8AM. His ops manager Marco is already stressed — there's a double-booking, a missing generator, and a client threatening to withhold payment because "your guys were late three times this month." Antonio has no way to verify any of this. He calls three site leads, gets three different stories. By noon he's burned half his day on firefighting instead of the two sales meetings he had planned. He approves a €12K equipment purchase based on Marco saying "we need it" — but he has no idea if the four they already own are even being used. With ShiftBuddy, Antonio would open a dashboard over coffee: task completion rate, asset utilization, overdue jobs, flagged issues. He'd know the generator is at Site B (not missing), the client complaints correlate with a specific crew (not a company-wide problem), and two of the four existing units sat idle last week. He makes the sales meetings. He doesn't buy the fifth unit.

```

**Key insight:** The system only works if José uses it. José will only use it if it lives in WhatsApp and takes less effort than what he does today. Every design decision flows from this constraint.
