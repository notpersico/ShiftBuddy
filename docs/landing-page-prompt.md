Copy this entire prompt into your builder of choice (v0, Bolt, Lovable, etc.)

---

## PROMPT START

You are a world-class landing page designer and conversion copywriter. Build a complete, production-ready landing page for **ShiftBuddy** — a B2B SaaS that turns WhatsApp into an ops task manager and asset control system for field teams.

### BRAND

- **Name:** ShiftBuddy
- **Tagline:** "Your field ops, finally under control."
- **Tone:** Confident, no-bullshit, empathetic to blue-collar pain. Not corporate. Not cutesy. Think: the smart friend who actually works on job sites.
- **Colors:** 
  - Primary: Deep navy (#1B2A4A) — authority, trust
  - Accent: Electric orange (#FF6B35) — urgency, action, construction
  - Secondary: White (#FFFFFF) and warm gray (#F5F5F0)
  - Success green (#22C55E) for status indicators
- **Font:** Inter or similar clean sans-serif. Bold headers, readable body.
- **Visual style:** Clean, modern, high-contrast. Mix of dashboard UI mockups and construction/field photography. No stock photos of people in suits. Real work environments — dirt, trucks, hard hats, WhatsApp screenshots.

### PAGE STRUCTURE (scroll order)

#### 1. HERO SECTION
- **Headline:** "Stop Chasing. Start Managing."
- **Subheadline:** "ShiftBuddy turns your WhatsApp groups into a real-time ops dashboard. Assign tasks, track assets, close shifts — all from the chat your crews already use."
- **CTA button:** "Book a Demo" (links to https://calendly.com/alessiopersichettidev/product-meeting)
- **Secondary CTA:** "See How It Works" (scrolls to demo section)
- **Visual:** Split layout — left side: a WhatsApp chat mockup showing a task assignment ("Marco → Luigi: Deliver generator to Via Roma site by 9AM ✅"), right side: a clean dashboard showing the same task with status, assignee, and asset location on a map pin.
- **Social proof bar** below hero: "Built for construction, logistics, rental & field services" with small industry icons

#### 2. PROBLEM SECTION — "Sound Familiar?"
Three pain point cards, each with an icon, stat, and one-liner:
- 🔍 **"Where's the excavator?"** — Site supervisors waste 30-60 min/day tracking equipment. That's 250+ hours/month on a 50-person crew.
- ⏰ **"Nobody told me"** — 15-20% of field delays come from equipment not being where expected. Each missed start: $500-$2,000 in idle time.
- 📋 **"Who had it last?"** — Construction loses $300M-$1B/year to "lost" equipment. Most isn't stolen — it's misplaced with no audit trail.

Below the cards, a single line in italic: *"Your crews already talk on WhatsApp. ShiftBuddy just makes those conversations count."*

#### 3. HOW IT WORKS — 3 Steps
Horizontal timeline or numbered vertical flow with illustrations:

**Step 1: Assign in WhatsApp**
"Managers send tasks like they always do — in WhatsApp. ShiftBuddy understands natural language: 'Luigi, deliver the compressor to Site B by 10AM.' No forms. No app switching."
→ Visual: WhatsApp chat bubble with task + ShiftBuddy bot confirming with a structured summary

**Step 2: Crews Confirm in Chat**
"Workers tap to confirm, log handoffs, and snap a photo when needed. No training. No new app. Takes 10 seconds."
→ Visual: WhatsApp quick-reply buttons (✅ Accepted / 📸 Photo Sent / 🔄 Handoff Logged)

**Step 3: Dashboard Does the Rest**
"Every chat becomes data. See all tasks, asset locations, overdue items, and custody chains — in real time."
→ Visual: Dashboard mockup with kanban board (Pending / Active / Overdue / Done), asset map, and a notification badge showing "3 overdue"

#### 4. FEATURES GRID
2x3 or 3x2 grid of feature cards with icons:

- **📱 WhatsApp-Native** — No new app. Works in the chat your crews already use. Supports Italian, English, Spanish, Arabic.
- **📍 Asset Tracking** — Know where every vehicle, generator, scaffold, or tool was last seen. Full custody chain.
- **✅ Task Management** — Assign, confirm, escalate, close. Morning dispatch to end-of-shift in one flow.
- **📊 Live Dashboard** — Kanban board, overdue alerts, daily reports. Your ops at a glance.
- **📸 Photo Evidence** — Request photos on demand. Attached to tasks automatically. No more "send it to the group."
- **🔔 Smart Escalation** — Overdue task? ShiftBuddy pings the worker, then the supervisor. No manual follow-up.

#### 5. WHO IT'S FOR — Industry Cards
Four cards, each with industry name, icon, and a specific use case:

- **🏗️ Construction** — "Track excavators, assign site tasks, log equipment moves across projects."
- **🚛 Logistics & Fleet** — "Dispatch drivers, confirm deliveries, track trailers and containers."
- **🔧 Equipment Rental** — "Log handoffs, prevent rental overages, settle disputes with timestamped proof."
- **⚡ Field Services** — "Assign service calls, confirm completions, track high-value tools and generators."

#### 6. BEFORE / AFTER
Two-column comparison:

**Without ShiftBuddy:**
- ❌ 30-60 min/day chasing "where is it?"
- ❌ Tasks lost in group chat noise
- ❌ No proof of who had what, when
- ❌ Excel + WhatsApp + whiteboard = chaos
- ❌ Equipment "disappears" between sites

**With ShiftBuddy:**
- ✅ Real-time asset visibility in one dashboard
- ✅ Every task assigned, confirmed, tracked
- ✅ Timestamped custody chain with photos
- ✅ One system, zero app installs for crews
- ✅ Full accountability, zero finger-pointing

#### 7. SOCIAL PROOF / EARLY ACCESS SECTION
Since this is pre-launch, use a credibility section:
- "Currently in early access with field teams across Italy"
- A quote block (even if placeholder): *"We went from 45 minutes of morning chaos to a 5-minute dashboard check."* — Early Access Partner
- Logos section placeholder: "Trusted by teams managing 50-500+ assets"

#### 8. PRICING TEASER
Don't show full pricing. Instead:
- "**Starts at €X/team/month**" (leave X as placeholder)
- "Free pilot for qualifying teams"
- CTA: "Book a Demo to Get Early Access Pricing"

#### 9. FAQ (Collapsible accordion)
- **"Do my workers need to install anything?"** — No. ShiftBuddy works inside WhatsApp. If they can send a message, they can use ShiftBuddy.
- **"What languages does it support?"** — Italian, English, Spanish, and Arabic at launch. More coming based on demand.
- **"What assets can I track?"** — Anything that moves between people or sites: vehicles, heavy equipment, generators, containers, scaffolding, tools — you name it.
- **"How long does setup take?"** — Under 30 minutes. We connect to your WhatsApp Business account and you're live.
- **"Is my data secure?"** — Yes. GDPR-compliant, encrypted in transit and at rest. Your data is yours.

#### 10. FINAL CTA SECTION
Full-width colored section (navy background, orange CTA):
- **Headline:** "Your crews are already on WhatsApp. Let's make it work for you."
- **CTA:** "Book Your Demo" → https://calendly.com/alessiopersichettidev/product-meeting
- **Below CTA:** "15-minute call. No commitment. See ShiftBuddy in action."

#### 11. FOOTER

### TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS
- Fully responsive (mobile-first — these buyers are on phones)

- Smooth scroll animations (subtle, not distracting)
- All CTA buttons link to: https://calendly.com/alessiopersichettidev/product-meeting

### DESIGN INSPIRATION
- Linear.app (clean, bold, dark sections)
- Vercel.com (modern SaaS aesthetic)  
- Notion.so (simple but punchy)

### WHAT TO AVOID
- ❌ Generic stock photos of smiling office workers
- ❌ Walls of text — every section should be scannable in 5 seconds
- ❌ "AI-powered" buzzwords — our buyers don't care about AI, they care about results
- ❌ Complex pricing tables — keep it simple, drive to demo
- ❌ Animations that slow down page load
- ❌ Any mention of "blockchain", "machine learning", or tech jargon
