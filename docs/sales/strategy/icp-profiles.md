# ShiftBuddy — ICP Profiles

> **Last updated:** 2026-02-16
> **Purpose:** Define who we sell to, what hurts them, and how ShiftBuddy solves it.

---

## ICP 1: Mid-Size Construction Companies

**Profile:** 30–150 employees, 3–10 active sites, mix of owned and rented equipment.

**Why them:**
- Highest asset density per worker. Equipment moves between sites daily.
- Coordination is 100% informal — WhatsApp groups, phone calls, whiteboards.
- Subcontractor dependency (80% of labor) makes centralized tools impractical.

**Pain we target:**
- *"Where is it?" syndrome* — Site supervisors burn 30–60 min/day tracking equipment across sites. That's 250+ hours/month wasted at a 50-person operation.
- *No handoff accountability* — Equipment changes hands with a nod. When something's damaged or missing, nobody can prove who had it last.
- *Task slippage* — 15–20% of field delays trace to equipment not being where expected. Each missed start = €500–2,000 in idle crew cost.

**How we solve it:**
- Crew confirms task assignments and equipment handoffs via WhatsApp — no new app.
- Every handoff is timestamped with photo proof → chain of custody is automatic.
- Manager dashboard shows real-time task status + last-known asset location → no more phone tag.

**Buyer:** Operations/Site Manager (feels the daily pain) · Owner/GM (signs the check when shown €40K/yr in losses)

## ICP 2: Equipment Rental Companies

**Profile:** 50–200 employees, 200–1,000+ tracked assets, regional operators.

**Why them:**
- Every checkout, return, and transfer is a dispute waiting to happen.
- 8–12% revenue leakage from unreturned or late-returned assets is industry standard.
- They already tried GPS fleet tools — field guys don't open them, data goes stale.

**Pain we target:**
- *Rental disputes* — Assets come back damaged with no documentation. Proving condition-at-handoff is impossible. Disputes cost more than repairs.
- *Utilization blind spots* — Managers discover idle equipment only when someone physically walks past it. Double-booking is common.
- *€3M fleet tracked on spreadsheets* — They bought fancy software, crews won't use it, so they're back to 47-tab Excel files.

**How we solve it:**
- Return handoffs include condition photos + checklist via WhatsApp → damage flagged same-day, not discovered a month later.
- Dashboard shows real-time asset status: rented / idle / in-maintenance → no more double-booking.
- Zero app install for field workers = actual adoption, not shelfware.

## ICP 3: Logistics & Last-Mile Delivery

**Profile:** 30–150 employees, delivery fleet (vans, trucks), 50+ daily dispatches.

**Why them:**
- High-frequency asset movement — vehicles, parcels, route assets change hands every shift.
- Dispatchers coordinate via WhatsApp groups that become unmanageable at 30+ drivers.
- Proof-of-delivery and handoff accountability are contractual requirements they're failing to meet.

**Pain we target:**
- *Coordination noise* — Dispatch messages get buried in 200-message WhatsApp threads. Drivers miss reassignments. Wrong deliveries happen.
- *No shift accountability* — End-of-day vehicle condition is untracked. Who had the van when it got scratched? Unknown.
- *Supervisor time drain* — 2–3 hours/day spent chasing status updates instead of managing exceptions.

**How we solve it:**
- Structured task cards in WhatsApp replace noisy group messages → drivers see clear assignments with address, route, equipment list.
- End-of-shift check-in flow via WhatsApp → vehicle condition logged automatically with photos.
- Manager dashboard aggregates all driver confirmations → dispatcher sees live status instead of scrolling chat.

## ICP 4: Field Services (HVAC, Plumbing, Electrical, Maintenance)

**Profile:** 20–100 employees, 10–50 daily job dispatches, van-based operations.

**Why them:**
- Owner-operators trying to scale from 30 to 100 without back-office collapse.
- They've tried Jobber, ServiceTitan, Housecall Pro — crews won't use them. WhatsApp wins every time.
- Tool and parts inventory walks out the door — €40K/yr in write-offs is common.

**Pain we target:**
- *Tool/parts shrinkage* — Nobody tracks who took what from the van. Annual write-offs are accepted as "cost of doing business."
- *Job visibility gap* — Owner has no idea if jobs are running on time without calling 3 managers every morning.
- *Customer disputes* — "Your guys were late 3 times this month" — owner can't verify because there's no log.

**How we solve it:**
- Morning task assignment via WhatsApp with equipment checklist → crew confirms what they're carrying.
- Job completion logged in WhatsApp with timestamps and photos → owner sees a weekly summary dashboard.
- Full task log with timestamps = dispute resolution in one call, not three days.

**Buyer:** Owner/GM (feels the margin bleed) · Operations Manager (daily firefighter)

## ICP 5: Facility Management Companies

**Profile:** 40–200 employees, managing multiple client sites (offices, malls, hospitals).

**Why them:**
- SLA-driven contracts where missed maintenance = financial penalties.
- Equipment (cleaning rigs, HVAC units, maintenance tools) rotates across client sites.
- High staff turnover means tribal knowledge disappears constantly.

**Pain we target:**
- *SLA compliance risk* — Scheduled maintenance gets missed because task assignment is verbal. Client finds out before the FM company does.
- *Asset rotation chaos* — Equipment moves between 10+ client sites with no log. "Where's the floor scrubber?" becomes a daily question.
- *Onboarding friction* — New hires take 2+ weeks to get productive because processes live in people's heads, not systems.

**How we solve it:**
- Scheduled tasks pushed via WhatsApp with confirmation required → missed tasks surface immediately on dashboard.
- Asset check-in/check-out at each client site via WhatsApp → rotation history is automatic.
- Standardized task flows in WhatsApp = new hires follow the same process from day one.

## Priority Ranking

| # | ICP | Priority | Rationale |
|---|-----|----------|-----------|
| 1 | Construction | **Primary** | Biggest pain, highest asset value, most WhatsApp-native, largest TAM |
| 2 | Equipment Rental | **Primary** | Revenue leakage is quantifiable, dispute resolution = instant ROI |
| 3 | Logistics & Last-Mile | **Secondary** | High frequency but more commoditized, stronger existing competition |
| 4 | Field Services | **Secondary** | Strong fit but smaller deal size, owner-buyer can be slow to move |
| 5 | Facility Management | **Tertiary** | Good fit but longer sales cycle, SLA angle needs case studies first |

## Common Thread Across All ICPs

**The universal insight:** Field teams already coordinate on WhatsApp. The problem isn't communication — it's that nothing is structured, tracked, or accountable. ShiftBuddy doesn't replace WhatsApp. It makes WhatsApp *work* as an ops system.

**The adoption unlock:** Zero app installs. Zero training. If your crew can send a WhatsApp message, they can use ShiftBuddy. That's why we win where Jobber, ServiceTitan, Samsara, and every enterprise EAM/CMMS fails — adoption.
