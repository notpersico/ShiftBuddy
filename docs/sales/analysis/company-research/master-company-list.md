### Tier C Companies (Score 25-49) — 42 total

Remaining companies score 25-49 due to missing employee data (size=0), Tier 2 geography (geo=10), and/or no direct signals (signal=0). ICP 4/5 companies also score lower due to Industry Fit being 20 (Field Services) or 10 (Facility Management) vs 25 for Construction/Equipment Rental.

Key Tier C companies that could upgrade with enrichment data:
- **Bhering** (BR, ICP 4, Score: 35) — If employee count confirms 50-100, upgrades to 55 (B)
- **Al Saheeh Group** is Tier B at 60 (only UAE ICP 4 company with LinkedIn)
- All ICP 5 companies outside UK score 25-30 — structurally disadvantaged by rubric
