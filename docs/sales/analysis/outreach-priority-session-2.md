## Competitor Positioning (for outreach messaging)

### vs. SymTerra (UK, GBP 1.1M raised)
- SymTerra = "WhatsApp ALTERNATIVE" → requires app download, training, behavior change
- ShiftBuddy = "WhatsApp IS the app" → zero adoption friction, WhatsApp-native
- SymTerra targets larger UK firms (GBP 5B projects); ShiftBuddy targets 30-200 employee companies

### vs. AlterSquare (Global, content-led)
- AlterSquare = Full platform migration from Excel/WhatsApp

- Key message: "Migration from WhatsApp isn't the answer — your crews won't do it. ShiftBuddy works INSIDE WhatsApp"
